Postmortem:
Following the release of ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19, around 06:00 West African Time (WAT) in Nigeria, an outage ensued on a dedicated Ubuntu 14.04 container hosting an Apache web server. During this period, GET requests to the server resulted in 500 Internal Server Errors, contrary to the expected response of an HTML file defining a basic Holberton WordPress site.

Debugging Process:
Bug debugger Brennan (BDB... derived from my actual initials) encountered the issue upon project initiation, approximately 19:20 PST, and promptly embarked on resolving the problem.

Checked running processes using 'ps aux'. Confirmed two apache2 processes - root and www-data - were operational.
Explored the sites-available directory within /etc/apache2/, determining that content was being served from /var/www/html/.
Ran strace on the root Apache process PID in one terminal while curling the server in another. Despite high hopes, strace yielded no actionable insights.
Repeated step 3 on the www-data process PID. Managed expectations this time but received a breakthrough - strace unveiled an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error when attempting to access /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.
Methodically scanned files in the /var/www/html/ directory using Vim pattern matching, identifying the erroneous .phpp extension in the wp-settings.php file (Line 137: require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );).
Rectified the issue by removing the trailing 'p' from the line.
Tested the server with another curl request, resulting in a successful 200 response.
Developed a Puppet manifest to automate resolution of similar errors.
Summary:
In essence, a typo. The WordPress application encountered a critical error in wp-settings.php due to an attempt to load class-wp-locale.phpp, while the correct filename in the wp-content directory was class-wp-locale.php. The remedy involved a simple correction of the typo, eliminating the trailing 'p'.

Prevention:
This outage stemmed from an application error rather than a web server issue. To avert such incidents in the future, consider the following measures:

Prioritize thorough testing of the application before deployment to identify and address errors promptly.
Implement status monitoring systems like UptimeRobot to promptly alert to website outages.
As a response to this incident, a Puppet manifest 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp was authored to automate resolution of identical errors in the future, replacing phpp extensions with php in /var/www/html/wp-settings.php. However, we anticipate no recurrence, given our commitment to error-free programming practices.i
