Networking Basics
This repository contains scripts and information related to networking basics, focusing on key concepts and protocols. Below are details for each task:

0. OSI Model
Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract framework describing layered communication and computer network design. It categorizes communication functions from the lowest to the highest level, aiding in understanding complex interactions in networking.

Project Focus
This project emphasizes:

The Transport layer, specifically TCP/UDP
The Network layer, featuring IP and ICMP
Refer to the 0-OSI_model file for detailed information.

1. Types of Network
Overview
This task explores different types of networks, distinguishing between LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network). It also discusses network connections over the Internet.

Questions Explored
What type of network is a computer in a local connected to?
What type of network connects offices in different buildings a few streets away?
What network is used when browsing www.google.com from a smartphone (not connected to WiFi)?
Refer to the 1-types_of_network file for detailed information.

2. MAC and IP Address
Overview
This task delves into MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, understanding their roles as identifiers for network interfaces.

Questions Explored
What is a MAC address?
What is an IP address?
Refer to the 2-MAC_and_IP_address file for detailed information.

3. UDP and TCP
Overview
The focus of this task is on UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), examining their characteristics in data transfer.

Questions Explored
Correct statement for the TCP box.
Correct statement for the UDP box.
Correct statement for the TCP worker.
Refer to the 3-UDP_and_TCP file for detailed information.

4. TCP and UDP Ports
Overview
This task deals with TCP and UDP ports, essential for routing packets to the correct network devices. It also includes a Bash script to display listening ports.

Notable Ports
22: SSH
80: HTTP
443: HTTPS
Refer to the 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports file for detailed information.

5. Is the Host on the Network
Overview
This task involves ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and presents a Bash script for pinging an IP address to check its availability on the network.

Requirements
Accepts an IP address as an argument
Displays usage if no argument is passed
Performs 5 pings to the specified IP address
Refer to the 5-is_the_host_on_the_network file for detailed information.
