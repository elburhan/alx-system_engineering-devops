Regular Expression Learning Project

During this project, I gained proficiency in utilizing regular expressions, honing my skills through the creation of patterns using Ruby's Oniguruma library.

All the code in this repository underwent rigorous testing using Rubular, a Ruby-based regular expression editor. Rubular proved to be a valuable tool, enabling real-time testing of regular expressions during the development process.
